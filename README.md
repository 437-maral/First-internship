The main objective of the study was to investigate whether DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood cells can serve as a reliable biomarker for detecting individuals at high risk of developing T2D. 

In the first phase of the study, specific DNAm patterns were identified to categorize prediabetic patients in the discovery cohort. Next, a replication cohort was used to validate the identified DNAm markers and assess their reproducibility and stability.
Firstly , preliminary work involved analyzing DNAm data from the blood cells of 72 female participants in the discovery cohort. The study grouped samples based on DNAm profiles and clinical parameters using PAM clustering. With a wrapper method, 2,020 CpGs were identified and combined with clinical parameters to accurately stratify prediabetic participants into three high-risk clusters with 92 % accuracy. However, the replication study with 48 female participants could not distinguish prediabetic individuals into three high-risk clusters using the identified CpGs. Different machine learning approaches, including Archetypes and Random Forest, were explored, but no specific CpGs showed good accuracy for both cohorts.
